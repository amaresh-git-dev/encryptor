# encryptor

encryptor with 3DES is a Python-based project that provides a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt images using the Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) algorithm. With this tool, you can protect your sensitive images by applying encryption and securely decrypt them when needed.

## Features

- **Image encryption**: Encrypt an image file using the 3DES algorithm for enhanced security.
- **Image decryption**: Decrypt an encrypted image file using the same encryption key and algorithm.
- **File format compatibility**: Support for various image file formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, and more.
- **Password-based encryption**: Encrypt and decrypt images using a password-based key derivation function (KDF).
- **User-friendly interface**: The script offers a command-line interface for easy input and output interactions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (`pip install pillow`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the Pillow library by running the following command:

```shell
pip install pillow
